# odin_recipes

This is the first project about recipes, that I'll be working on. I'll be using the skills and functions I've learned about creating files and connecting those files to Github, and then creating a html web page about recipes using the various html elements and tags for the project. I'm excited and a little nervous as I will have to re-learn some of the git commands on how to link my files to Github on terminal and then how to set those files to "staging" level or the "commit" level.
